Some IOT stuff for my home

The file **pyiot.py** requires a separate file with secrets inside. Create a file named **secrets.py** in the same directory as pyiot.py and fill it with the following information.

Of course the values should be replaced with the relevant ones depending on your setup:


```
broker_address = "127.0.0.1"<br />
port = 12345<br />
user = "a username here"<br />
password = "the password here"<br />
```
